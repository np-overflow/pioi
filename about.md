# About

PIOI is a 5 hour programming contest that focus on testing problem solving skills as well as data structures and algorithms knowledge. During the contest, contestants will be given problem statements which they have to solve by writing efficient code. Contestants will then submit their solutions to the grading system, which will automatically test their code with test cases and award points to them.

## Platform / languages

Participants may use any of the following programming languages to implement solutions to contest problems: Python 3.8.10 (CPython), Java 11 LTS (OpenJDK 11) or C++11 (g++ 7.4.0). The contest will use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as its OS platform.

## Submission

Participants have to submit their solutions to the grading system during the contest. No late submissions will be entertained. Submissions must be less then 500KB in size, take less then 15 seconds to compile, run for at most 45 seconds and use a maximum of 512MiB of memory.
